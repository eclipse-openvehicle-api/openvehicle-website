   // definitions and declarations.

   // REMARKS: Using the "core_idl.h" works once; after that CMake detects circular dependencies and doesn't want to build any
   // more. Therefore, it is advisable to use it only for checking the interfaces.
   // To re-allow building again after a circular reference, clear the CMake cache (in the project-menu item).
