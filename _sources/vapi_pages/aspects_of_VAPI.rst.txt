Aspects of Open Vehicle API
===========================

.. important::
   | **What if…**
   | 
   | ... we see the car not just as a machine, but as a **digital platform** — where functionality is defined by **software**, not hardware. A platform that evolves continuously, gaining new features and capabilities over time.
   | 
   | ... we could **update all vehicle software overnight** — not only to add new features, but also to fix bugs, ensure compliance with new regulations, and strengthen protection against cyber threats?
   | 
   | ... we could **deploy the same software across multiple vehicle platforms**, without worrying about compatibility issues?
   | 
   | ... we could **integrate AI** to assist drivers with operating everyday vehicle functions — making driving smarter, safer, and more intuitive?
   | 
   | This isn’t science fiction.  
   | **This is happening now.**  
   | **And we are building it — together.**

The increasing complexity of modern vehicle software requires robust, scalable, and future-oriented frameworks. Especially in the context of safety-critical applications, distributed systems, and agile development processes, new approaches must be developed to meet growing demands.

Function development requirements
---------------------------------
-	Signal-based time triggered
-	Model-based with code generation
-	Main language “C” with global variables and methods
-	Development often done by function developer; no deep programming knowledge available
-	Programming is a necessary evil, automate as much as possible
-	Safety almost always an issue

Build one, apply many
---------------------
-	Function development independent of vehicle type and HW infrastructure
-	Aims for zonal based architecture using one or more (virtual) HPCs running a POSIX OS (Prototype uses Linux)
-	Development locally and simulation in the cloud on Windows and Linux
-	Direct testing on development PC (simplified SIL)
-	Validating functionality for a variety of vehicles in the cloud (validation SIL)
-	Validating functionality for a variety of HW setups (centralized HIL)

Use standardization and automation
----------------------------------
-	Allow multiple types of vehicle buses (protype uses CAN).
-	Automate code generation for the vehicle bus abstraction (protype uses DBC).
-	Allow multiple standardized application interfaces like Covesa VSS or CAAM  (prototype uses VSS).
-	Automate code generation for the vehicle abstraction, publisher.
-	Automate code generation for the application, subscriber.
-	Use a standard interface between software components (IDL based on ISO/IEC -19516*).
-	Automate code generation for interfacing and marshalling RPC calls.

Future aspects
--------------
-	Multiple vendors supplying functions
-	Mixed open and closed source development
-	Fixed setup on a system running within a safety context (ASIL A/B)
-	Dynamic installation (extendibility) of functions per (temporary) subscription within QM context
-	Appstore with available functions
-	Impact reduction of faulty components through process isolation
-	Installation and update per OTA
-	Diagnostics per SOVD

Conclusion
----------

This framework addresses these key topics and requirements to actively support future developments in automotive software engineering. The focus lies on aspects such as mixed-criticality, event-driven architecture, and a structured test, validation, and release process.
