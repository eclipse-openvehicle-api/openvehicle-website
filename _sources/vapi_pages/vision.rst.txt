          &nbsp;Customer: </br>&quot;As I am used to with my phone, I want to be able to download software from an app store at any time. 
          This includes software that was not available when I bought the car. 
          I want to be able to choose from different manufacturers. And I want to be able to update or replace my software.&quot;

          &nbsp;Software company: </br>&quot;I want to write software components which run on any vehicle. Instead of starting from scratch I want to add functionality by using existing components from different vendors.
          I do not need the code of these components. Implementation is hidden, standardized interfaces to use these components are enough, compatibility is no problem. 
          Software components must be independent from each other, interference must be impossible. I do not want to care about these problems.&quot;

          &nbsp;Car manufacturer: </br>&quot;I want to bring one or multiple high-performance computers (HPC) into my car. It must be possible, that multiple software programs from different vendors can run on these HPCs.
          The functions run in mixed critical: while there is a QM mode also a safety mode is implemented. Although the software is written and released in short time cycles the safety standard (ISO 26262) is still met.&quot;
