Packaging & Installation
========================


.. note:: Installation part is under construction. That's why in the cmake files we have to copy toml files after we created packages with the ``sdv_packager``

sdv_packager
~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Description:**
Creates, installs, verifies, and uninstalls SDV component installation packages.  

**Role:**
Used to bundle and deploy components after code generation. Supports both traditional packaging and direct installation workflows.

**Available Commands:**
- ``PACK``, ``INSTALL``, ``DIRECT_INSTALL``, ``UNINSTALL``, ``VERIFY``, ``SHOW``

**Example Usage:**

.. code-block:: console

    sdv_packager.exe DIRECT_INSTALL ExampleInterfaceComponents --instance<1000> -I<C:\Repo_VAPI\vapi-cpp-vehicle-api-platform\build\gcc_w64_mingw_debug\bin> --interface_config --overwrite

        commands:
        PACK            = create an installation package
        INSTALL         = install an installation package                              
        DIRECT_INSTALL  = install the components directly without creating an installation package
        UNINSTALL       = uninstall a previously installed installation package
        VERIFY          = verify the integrity of the installation package
        SHOW            = show information about the installation package
