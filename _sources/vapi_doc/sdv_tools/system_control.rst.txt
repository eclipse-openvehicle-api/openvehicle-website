==============

sdv_control
~~~~~~~~~~~

**Description:**
Main control utility for managing the SDV server and services. Supports startup, shutdown, installation, and service lifecycle operations. 

**Role:**
Used to initialize the SDV system, manage installed components, and control service execution dynamically. 

sdv_trace_mon
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Description:**
Monitors log messages from the SDV server for debugging and diagnostics.  

**Role:**
Used during development and runtime to observe system behavior, trace issues, and validate service interactions.  

sdv_local_shutdown
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Description:**
Shuts down a locally started SDV core instance.  

**Role:**
Used to terminate the SDV system in standalone or simulation environments without disrupting other processes.

System Internals
----------------

sdv_core
~~~~~~~~

**Description:**
The core application that runs the SDV service framework. Supports both local simulation and server-based operation. 

**Role:**
Central runtime component that hosts :term:`Vehicle Device` s and :term:`Basic Service` s. Typically started via ``sdv_control``.

sdv_iso
~~~~~~~

**Description:**
Runs components in isolated processes to improve system stability and fault tolerance due to :term:`Freedom from Interference`.

**Role:**
Used at runtime to separate critical or potentially unstable components, such as :term:`Complex Service` s, from the core process. Enables dynamic loading and unloading of services without affecting the main system.

**Example Usage:**

.. code-block:: console

    $ sdv_iso.exe eyJjb21wb25lbnQiOiAiRXhhbXBsZUNvbXBvbmVudCJ9 --verbose --install_dir=core/
