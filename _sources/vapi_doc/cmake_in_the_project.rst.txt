CMake in the project
====================

.. tip:: Useful to know: CMake Configuration vs Build Steps

    **Configuration-Time Commands**

    - `configure_file(...)`: Generates config headers.
    - `file(COPY ...)`: Copies files during configuration.
    - `set(...)`: Defines variables used in build logic.
    - `execute_process(COMMAND ...)`: Executes an executable.

    **Build-Time Commands**

    - `add_library(...)`: Defines targets built during the build step.
    - `add_executable(...)`: Defines targets built during the build step.
    - `target_link_libraries(...)`: Links libraries during build.

**Basic CMake commands:**

.. code-block:: text

    message("Output directory: ${CMAKE_RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY}")

Prints the given string and/or CMake variable to the console.

.. code-block:: text

    cmake_minimum_required (<version_no>)

- Sets the minimum required version of cmake for the project. It will affects the way of cmake configuration and build process.
- It is necessary to invoke this command at the beginning top level of CMakeLists.txt file before invoking any other command.

.. code-block:: text

    cmake_policy (<version_no>)

- It will mention cmake to use the new or old behavior of the mentioned <policy_no>. 
- And also cmake_minimum_required() will implicitly invokes this command.

.. code-block:: text

    set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD <standard_no>)

This command will set the C++ standard to given <standard_no>.

.. code-block:: text

    $ENV{env_var}

ENV is an operator through which we can read the value of the given environment variable <env_var>.

.. code-block:: text

    if(DEFINED env_var) or if (NOT DEFINED env_var) 
    endif()

To check whether the env_var was defined or not. 

.. code-block:: text

    add_compile_options(<option>)

It will add options which will be used to get compiled for targets. 

.. code-block:: text

    find_package(<package_name>)

- cmake will find the mentioned package and will load its package specific details.
- example : find_package(Threads).

**CMake commands to build the projects:**

.. code-block:: text

    add_subdirectory(<sub_directory_name>)

It adds the mentioned <sub_directory_name> to the cmake build process.

.. code-block:: text

    project(project_name)

It sets the project name and stores in the given variable <project_name>.

.. code-block:: text   

    include_directories(<directory_name>) 

- The include files which are stored in given <directory_name> or environment variable will be added to the cmake build process. 
- example include the framework headre files: 

    include_directories(${SDV_FRAMEWORK_DEV_INCLUDE}).

.. code-block:: text

    execute_process(COMMAND <command1> <argument1> <argument2> ....)

It executes one or more child processes or commands sequentially. Since the command runs an .exe, no intermediate command interpreter is executed. It is widly used to auto generated code with ``sdv_dbc_util`` and ``sdv_vss_util``.

.. code-block:: text

    file (COPY <filename> DESTINATION <destination_directory>)

- Copies files during configuration.
- Mainly used to copy the configuration files to the output sub folder. 
- example to copy a configuration file: 

    file (COPY ${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/config/CanComSimulation.toml DESTINATION ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/bin/config).

.. code-block:: text

    add_custom_target(<target_name>
    ALL
    DEPENDS
        <dependencies>
        ....
    COMMAND <commands>
    VERBATIM
    )

- It will adds a target with the mentioned name and will executes the mentioned commands. 
- This target will be added to the default build target, so it will run every time.
- when the target was built, the mentioned dependencies also will be updated.
- example:

    add_custom_target(example_interface_config
    ALL
    DEPENDS can_dl_example
    COMMAND "${SDV_PACKAGER}" DIRECT_INSTALL ExampleInterfaceComponents --instance3001 can_dl_example.sdv 
    VERBATIM
    )
    
.. code-block:: text

    add_dependencies(<target> <target-dependency>...)

- It will make sure that mentioned top level dependency target got compiled before <target> does. 
- example: add_dependencies(example_application  ExampleGeneralComponent ExampleAccessToOtherComponents).

.. code-block:: text

    add_test(NAME <test_name> COMMAND <command>)

- Adds a test called <test_name> to the project. 
- enable_testing() command should be invoked in order to generate tests by cmake. 
- example : add_test(NAME configuration_example COMMAND configuration_example).

**Build SDV binaries:**

.. code-block:: text

    add_library(<target_name> <type>
    <path_to_include_files>
    <path_to_source_files>
    )

- This command will add a library which was mentioned as demo_complex_service which will be built from the given source and include files.
- type - SHARED or STATIC or MODULE : The mentioned library will be created as a dynamic or static or module based library.
- example : add_library(ExampleVehicleDevice SHARED Code/Example_VehicleDevice.cpp).

.. code-block:: text

    set_target_properties(<target_name> PROPERTIES <property1> <value1>)
    set_target_properties(<target_name> PROPERTIES <property2> <value2>)

- It sets the properties of values which will affects the given one or more targets. 
- example for the sdv binaries: 

    - set_target_properties(<target_name> PROPERTIES SUFFIX ".sdv").
    - set_target_properties(<target_name> PROPERTIES OUTPUT_NAME "door_complex_service")
    - set_target_properties(<target_name> PROPERTIES PREFIX "")

**Build SDV executables:**

.. code-block:: text

    target_link_libraries(<executable_name> <lib1> <lib2> <lib3>)

- It links all the mentioned libraries to the given target. 
- example : target_link_libraries(system_extern_example Ws2_32 Winmm Rpcrt4.lib).

.. code-block:: text

    add_executable(<executable_name>
    <path_to_source_files>
    )

- It creates an executable which will be built from the mentioned source and include files. 
- example: add_executable(system_extern_example  example_app/system_extern_example.cpp).
