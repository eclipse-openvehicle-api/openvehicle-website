Simulation / Testing / FMU
==========================

Building up multiple systems to test a component in various environments is crucial for high quality.

.. figure:: ../vapi_media/architecture/test_driven_architecture.png
   :name: fig-test-validate-release-process

One additional test environment is ``OpenXilEnv`` which allows to load so called FMUs.

What is an FMU?
---------------

A FMU stands for Functional Mock-up Unit. It's a file format used in model-based systems engineering and simulation, especially within the FMI (Functional Mock-up Interface) standard.

A FMU is essentially a packaged simulation model that can be shared and executed across different tools. It contains:

- Model description (in our case auto generated by the ``sdv_dbc_util``)
- Compiled binaries 
- Optional source code 
- Resources (in our case the configuration files to load the VAPI components)

FMU created by ``sdv_dbc_util``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The cmake project for a FMU is created out of a dbc file. The dbc file includes all variable definitions. Beside of a data link component also the project for a FMU is created.

.. code-block:: rst

    Example: 

    sdv_dbc_util datalink_2doors_example.dbc -Ogenerated\\ --nodesdoors --version1.0.0.1 --moduleDoors2ExampleFMU --dl_lib_namecan_dl_example

    -O              output folder 'generated'
    --nodes         node in the dbc file to be used 'doors'
    --version       optional version information '1.0.0.1'
    --module        name of the FMU 'Doors4ExampleFMU'
    --dl_lib_name   datalink library name 'can_dl_example'

    Afterwards the following has to be done:
    - required configuration files have to be put into the subfolder
    e.g.  ...\fmu_Doors2ExampleFMU\Doors2ExampleFMU\resources

    - function OpenAPILoad() needs to be updated in the model.cpp file
    e.g.  ...\fmu_Doors2ExampleFMU\Doors2ExampleFMU\model.cpp

    - the cmake project will the create the FMU, the output is for example  
          ---\<outpufolder>\examples\system_demo_example\generated\fmu_DemoExampleFMU\fmus

Adaptions of the FMU
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1) The output of the created FMU project needs 2 addaptions:

.. code-block:: rst

    Add code for loading the VAPI components in function OpenAPILoad(): 

    bool OpenAPILoad(const std::string& resources)
    {
        bool success = CreateCoreServiceTomlFile(resources);
        ...

        success &= g_appcontrol->LoadConfig(...) == sdv::core::EConfigProcessResult::successful;
        success &= g_appcontrol->LoadConfig(...) == sdv::core::EConfigProcessResult::successful;
        ...

        g_appcontrol->SetRunningMode();
        return success;
    }

2) Required toml files (resource files) need to be put in the folder 'resources' below the FMU project:

.. code-block:: rst
   
    <FMU_CMAKE_PROJECT>\resources

Run a simulation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Link to ``OpenXilEnv``:

https://github.com/eclipse-openxilenv/openxilenv


All major examples include a FMU which can be loaded in the Open Source Software ``OpenXilEnv``. In this document we do not describe how to get and run the software but how our FMU is created and how it can be used.
''OpenXilEnv'' allows to start an ``external process``, in our case the FMU. When successfully loaded its easy to visualize all variables and to change the input variables. The variables also can be changed by a script. 

The simulation in ``OpenXilEnV`` can be enhanced by adding another FMU which represents the vehicle. We made demonstrations including another FMU. The second FMU contained either ``IPG CarMaker`` (a sophisticated simulation software developed by IPG Automotive) or ``Carla`` (Car Learning to Act, a powerful, open-source simulator designed specifically for autonomous driving research and development).

How to use a FMU
----------------

The following uses the FMU form the system demo example. The FMU can be found
<outpufolder>/examples/system_demo_example/generated/fmu_DemoExampleFMU/fmus

.. code-block:: rst
   
   The script (*.src file)
   .../examples/system_demo_example/fmu/vapi_system_demo.scr

- Open XilEnvGui.exe
- Generate new INI file
- Recommended: in upper menu click on RT-Factor Icon to switch from fast to slow: Instead of a high (cycling) number the number should be around 1.

.. figure:: ../vapi_media/openxilenv/rt-factor.png

- in XiLEnv Control Panel: Click on 'Add...' in 'Process'

../vapi_media/openxilenv/control_panel.png

- 'Start process' window opens, click on 'start an external process'
- Select file 'DemoExampleFMU.fmu'
- Right-Click somewhere 'New > Text' and open 'Blackboard'

.. figure:: ../vapi_media/openxilenv/blackboard.png

- Right-Click and open 'config'
  
.. figure:: ../vapi_media/openxilenv/config.png

- Add the 4 signals
- in XiLEnv Control Panel: Click on 'File...' in 'Internal Process Control' and add script file 'vapi_demo.scr'
- in XiLEnv Control Panel: Click on 'Run' in 'Internal Process Control'

.. figure:: ../vapi_media/openxilenv/process_control.png
