A view under the hood
=====================

Component Definition
--------------------

The V-API system uses the following characteristics:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Components are compiled software modules in binary form
* Components are linked dynamically during runtime
* Components communicate using interfaces
* Components can be used to build a dynamic framework
* The functionality of a system is determined by the composition of components
* Components are closed source and therefore can be written by 3rd parties
* Components are language independent
* Components are very close to a C++ class – performance is very high
* Components can be used using direct calls within the same process
* Components can be called in other processes using Remote Procedure Calls (RPC)

Components implemented easily with C++:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Interfaces are complex structures with only pure virtual functions
* Function pointers are managed through the V-table
* Components are classes deriving from interfaces

Binary components supported by OS:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Most modern OSes  support dynamic libraries (DLL or SO)
* Library uses dynamic (late) binding (instead of static binding by the linker)
* Type safety and error mitigation is responsibility of programmer (tooling)

Interface IDL
-------------

Component interface language: OMG IDL (ISO/IEC 19516)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* OMG IDL is part of the CORBA specification
* OMG IDL is used in DDS specification
* OMG IDL can be used as stand-alone language without CORBA
* OMG IDL is around since 1991 and still updated
* OMG IDL 4.2 was standardized in 2018 and the latest contribution dates February 2021
* OMG IDL license allows the implementation of software based on the (partial) specification
* OMG IDL language is very close to the C++ language specification, therefore easy to learn


.. figure:: ../vapi_media/architecture/overview/idl_file.png
   :name: fig-overview-idl-file

The IDL compiler generates code for:

* Header file to be used by caller and callee
* Proxy implementation for marshalling and communication
* Stub implementations for calling component functions and marshalling

Safety and Security
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are several safety and security considerations:

* Each interface receives a unique ID - allows access to the interface
* No interface change of same ID, regardless of platform
* Interface change of new ID, no mixing of old and new interfaces
* Serialization/deserialization protected with CRC32C
* Automatically detection of platform endianness + converting if necessary
* Free spec interpretation of data types are fixed within V-API for all platforms (e.g. wchar, wstring, native and any).
* Only specified exceptions are marshalled. No exception surprises. Other exceptions are caught and reported.

During the development of the :term:`VAPI Framework` several safety and security considerations were considered:

* Isolate complex services and applications (fault impact reduction)
* Profile based feature accessibility
* Prepared for the use of security roles
* Connection stealing prevented with runtime-based connection identification
