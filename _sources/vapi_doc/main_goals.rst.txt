Key Features
============

The primary goals of the Open Vehicle API are to provide a robust, flexible, and efficient framework for vehicle abstraction and integration. Below are the key goals of the Open Vehicle API:

1. **Simplify Vehicle Abstraction**  

   Provide a unified and component-based framework to abstract vehicle functionalities across different platforms and hardware.

2. **Ensure Modularity**  

   Enable developers to create modular components that can be easily replaced or extended without affecting the overall system.

3. **Promote Interoperability**  

   Allow components developed by different suppliers to work seamlessly together, regardless of compiler or platform differences.

4. **Support Multiple Platforms**  

   Ensure compatibility with various operating systems and hardware platforms, including Windows and Linux.

5. **Minimize External Dependencies**  

   Reduce reliance on third-party libraries to simplify integration and improve maintainability.

6. **Enable Testability**  

   Ensure that all components can be tested in isolation to improve reliability and ease of debugging.

7. **Facilitate Event-Driven Architecture**  

   Design the framework to support event-driven communication while also allowing timed execution when necessary.

8. **Provide Freedom from Interference**  
   
   Ensure that components can operate independently without unintended interference, especially in multi-process setups.

9. **Support Scalability**  
   
   Allow the framework to scale from simple single-process applications to complex multi-process systems.

10. **Encourage Developer Productivity**  
    Provide clear documentation, examples, and tools to help developers quickly understand and use the framework.

.. note::  
   These goals are subject to refinement as the framework evolves to meet new challenges and requirements.
