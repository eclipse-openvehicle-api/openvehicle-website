Because we now run in a separate process we do not have access to the :term:`Data Dispatch Service` and :term:`Vehicle Device` . That's why we cannot display these data.

The signals now are coming via CAN bus by using the :term:`VAPI Component` ``can_com_sim.sdv`` from the framework. The :term:`VAPI Component` reads the CAN messages from a text file and sends these messages to the :term:`Data Link` The :term:`Data Link` component is created from a dbc file with the help of the helper tool ``sdv_dbc_util``.
