Examples of Open Vehicle API
============================

Before starting with the examples we have to explain the wording.

``Open Vehicle API`` is an application development framework above the middleware. In general context :term:`Vehicle Function` is often named as application or the other way around.

.. image:: ../../vapi_media/examples/expression_in_contect_of_open_vapi.png

In context of ``Open Vehicle API`` it is different: the :term:`Vehicle Function` will be implemented as :term:`Complex Service` . In context of ``Open Vehicle API`` an application is either an :term:`Standalone Application` or an :term:`Extern Application`. A :term:`Standalone Application` contains all :term:`VAPI Component` s while an :term:`Extern Application` connects itself to a running ``Open Vehicle API`` instance.

A :term:`Complex Service` is meant to run in it own process and is supposed to connect to :term:`Basic Service` s and other :term:`Complex Service` s. A :term:`Complex Service` should not use :term:`interface` s of :term:`Vehicle Device` s. This will be avoided when we do not create :term:`Proxy` and :term:`Stub` code for the :term:`Vehicle Device` :term:`interface`.

      General layout of a standalone application:

      sdv::app::CAppControl appcontrol;
      appcontrol.AddModuleSearchDir(<path_to_component_binaries>);
      appcontrol.Startup("");
      appcontrol.SetConfigMode();
      appcontrol.AddConfigSearchDir(<path_to_configuration_files>);

      appcontrol->LoadConfig(<load_data_dispatch_service>);
      appcontrol->LoadConfig(<load_tasktimer_service>);
      - register your signals or load a data link component (which will register signals)
      appcontrol->LoadConfig(<load_your_components>);
      appcontrol.SetRunningMode();

         ... run your application

      - unregister signals in case no data link component was used
      appcontrol.Shutdown();

.. important:: 
   First, the configuration mode must be set. After that, the software modules can be loaded and configured. After setting the running mode no further modules can be loaded. A CAN component, for example, establishes its connections to the sockets and starts its Read/Write thread in configuration mode, but it does not yet read or write any CAN messages. Only after the running mode is set it should read and send messages

Basic Examples
--------------

The :term:`VAPI Framework` contains several different types of examples.

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

   basic_examples/basic_examples

**Basic examples:** First it is recommended to have a closer look at the basic examples to understand the basics of a SDV component and the principles of the framework.

Headlight Example
-----------------

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1
   
   auto_headlight_example/auto_headlight_example

**Headlight example:** This example shows the following :term:`Vehicle Function` : If the vehicle is in a tunnel, the headlights are turned on. Outside of the tunnel the lights are switched off. It is a perfect example to simulate the vehicle and to visualize the :term:`Vehicle Function` by the source software ``OpenXilEnv`` and ``Carla`` .
 

Door Service Example
--------------------

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1
   
   door_service_example/door_service_example

**Door service example:** This example shows one possibility to abstract a vehicle to support multiple doors.
Additional it contains the creation of an FMU to simulate :term:`VAPI component` s in the open source software ``OpenXilEnv``.

Open Trunk Example
--------------------

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1
   
   open_trunk_example/open_trunk_example

**Open trunk example:** This example will show a :term:`Mixed-Criticality` scenario: Two :term:`VAPI Component` s. As the example is running only one VAPI instance, the :term:`QM Function` can avoid the connection to the safety :term:`Complex Service` just by bypassing and using the :term:`Basic Service` directly. In :term:`Mixed-Criticality` mode the connection would be prevendet and the :term:`Complex Service` in this example could be seen as safety, ASIL rated component.

System Demo Example
-------------------

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1
   
   system_demo_example/system_demo   

**System demo example:** explains the different layers, how signals are handled and how an application or a core instance could look like.
Also the helper utilities ``sdv_dbc_util`` and ``sdv_vss_utl`` to create auto generated code are descripted.

.. important:: This example is worth to spent a time to deep dive into it as it contains the complete stack: its build up with auto generated code, runs with and without data link, generates an installation and shows how an external application connects itself to a running VAPI core instance.
