Example Interface Set
=====================

.. note::
   An :term:`Interface Set` is just a collection of :term:`Interface` s. These may not be from the same developer or company as long as each interface name is unique within the set. Also data structures may be described in an Interface Set. An :term:`Interface Set` can be composed of multiple header files. For components to be developed for a system the :term:`Interface Set` of the system has to be known.
