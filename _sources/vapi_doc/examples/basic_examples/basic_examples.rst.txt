Basic Examples explained in detail
==================================

.. note:: 
   | Following executables which can be found in ``<output-folder>/examples/bin`` will use all these basic examples:
   | example_run_all_components
   | example_application

Interfaces and how they are used:

.. toctree::
   example_interface
   example_interface_set
   example_general_component

Configuration of & access to other SDV components:

.. toctree::   
   example_general_component_with_initialization
   example_access_to_other_components
   example_config_file

Data dispatch service & signals

.. toctree::  
   example_use_data_dispatch_service

The chain of the SDV components:

data dispatch service → vehicle device → basic service → complex service

.. toctree::  
   example_vehicle_device
   example_basic_service
   example_complex_service
   example_application

The example shows a standalone application which loads all SDV components. This is required during development and for tests but the final target is to start a VAPI core instance. In that case an application is an extern process which will connect itself to a running VAPI core instance. The system demo example includes this scenario when starting and connecting to the instance 3001.
