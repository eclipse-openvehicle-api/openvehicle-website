Example Vehicle Device
=======================

.. note::
   The code in the following example is different from typical :term:`Vehicle Device` s in the way that the device in the example reads from and writes to the :term:`Data Dispatch Service`. In real life an :term:`Vehicle Device` will either write or read from :term:`Data Dispatch Service`, not both together.

To create a :term:`Vehicle Device` one just starts with a :ref:`general Component <example-general-component>`, sets the object type to ``AbstractDevice`` from the `EObjectType <exhale_define_component__impl_8h_1a23c0fa93f06b3d3dd3650e6dccd27913>`_ enum and provides :term:`interface` s to register callback functions which are triggered on signal updates.

      To write/send any data to the network the :term:`Data Dispatch Service` can be used. 
      First the :term:`Vehicle Device` must act as publisher and add its signal to an existing TxSignal which was created by the :term:`Data Link`.
      The method SetBrakeForce() is then published via an interface so that multiple basic services can set the signal value.

      .. note::
         See :ref:`Example Component with Initialization <example-general-componentwithinitialiation>` how to use :term:`Data Dispatch Service`.

      To get updated on signal change the :term:`Vehicle Device` has to subscribe the method callBackFunctionSpeedSignal() to
      an existing RxSignal which was created by the :term:`Data Link`.
      Anyone who has registered a callback will then be noticed on signal update.

      On Shutdown the signals have to be reset.

   .. tab-item:: Offer A Register Interface

      Event driven approach: Implement the :term:`VAPI Interface` which allows any :term:`Basic Service` to register a callback 
      (the :term:`Vehicle Device` event), which is called on any signal change so that a :term:`Basic Service` is automatically updated.
