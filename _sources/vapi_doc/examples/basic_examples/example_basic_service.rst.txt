Example Basic Service
=====================

.. note::
   The code in the following example is different from typical :term:`Basic Service` s in the way that the service in the example reads from and writes to the :term:`Vehicle Device`. In real life an vehicle device will either write or read from :term:`Vehicle Device`, not both together. The :term:`Vehicle Device` itself offers only one functionality, not both.

To create a :term:`Basic Service` one just starts with a :ref:`general Component <example-general-component>`, sets the object type to ``BasicService`` from the `EObjectType <exhale_define_component__impl_8h_1a23c0fa93f06b3d3dd3650e6dccd27913>`_ enum and adds functionality through implementing the inherited interfaces, using :term:`Vehicle Device` s, see :ref:`How to access other components <example-access-components>`.

      To write/send any data to the network the corresponding :term:`VAPI Interface` of the :term:`Vehicle Device` has to be used.

      First of all, the :term:`Basic Service` must register itself by calling the register method of the :term:`Vehicle Device`. 
      This is done in the constructor of the class. Event driven approach: now on any signal change the 'SetSpeedValue' method is called and the value is updated automatically. 
      Any :term:`Complex Service` or :term:`Extern Application` can get this value by polling 'GetSpeed()' or automatically if the :term:`Complex Service` or :term:`Extern Application` has registered a callback function.
      In this case the callback function of all registered methods will be called.

      If the :term:`Basic Service` has registered itself in the :term:`Vehicle Device` it has to unregister itself on shutdown.

      Event driven approach: Implement the :term:`VAPI Interface` which allows any :term:`Complex Service` or :term:`Extern Application` to register a callback 
      (the :term:`Vehicle Device` event), which is called on any signal change so that a :term:`Complex Service` or :term:`Extern Application` is automatically updated.
