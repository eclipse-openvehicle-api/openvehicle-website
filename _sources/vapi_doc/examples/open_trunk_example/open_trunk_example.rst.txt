.. attention:: Purpose: Demonstration safety topic, demonstration :term:`Mixed-Criticality` and why we need two instances: safety and non-safety instance.

.. hint:: 
   
   The :term:`Vehicle Function` will open the trunk. This should be blocked when the vehicle is moving:

   - Required: TX signal to open the trunk, RX signal representing the speed of the vehicle.  
   - A complex service offers an interface to open the trunk.
   - Before the command is forwarded to the basic service the vehicle speed is checked and denied accordingly to prevent the opening of the trunk.
   - Therefore the complex service can be seen as an ASIL A component.
