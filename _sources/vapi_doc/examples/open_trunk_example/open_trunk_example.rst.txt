Open Trunk Example
==================


.. attention:: Purpose: Demonstration safety topic, demonstration :term:`Mixed-Criticality` and why we need two instances: safety and non-safety instance.

.. note:: 
   | Example can be found in ``<output-folder>/examples/bin``:
   | open_trunk_example <parameter>

.. hint:: 
   
   The :term:`Vehicle Function` will open the trunk. This should be blocked when the vehicle is moving:

   - Required: TX signal to open the trunk, RX signal representing the speed of the vehicle.  
   - Convert the speed value from ``m/s`` to ``km/h``. This represents the vehicle abstraction when the input signal unit does not match the standardized interface definition.
   - A complex service offers an interface to open the trunk.
   - Before the command is forwarded to the basic service the vehicle speed is checked and denied accordingly to prevent the opening of the trunk.
   - Therefore the complex service can be seen as an ASIL A component.
