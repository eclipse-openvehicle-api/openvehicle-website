Open Trunk Extern Application
=============================

.. note:: 
   | Start instance:
   | sdv_control STARTUP --instance3005
   | Connect to this instance:
   | open_trunk_example 3005

.. note:: 

   - A :term:`Complex Service` offers an :term:`Interface` to open the trunk.
   - Before the command is forwarded to the :term:`Basic Service` the vehicle speed is checked and denied accordingly.
   - Therefore the :term:`Complex Service` can be seen as an ASIL A component.  
   - The :term:`Basic Service` must offer its :term:`Interface` over the process border: That's why the :term:`Proxy` & :term:`Stub` code is required.
   - If there is a second VAPI instance which represent a QM instance the connection to the :term:`Basic Service` can be prevented in general for :term:`QM Function` s.
   - In that case opening the trunk can not be triggered when the vehicle is moving.

The Speed signal is coming via CAN bus by using the :term:`VAPI Component` ``can_com_sim.sdv`` from the framework. The :term:`VAPI Component` reads the CAN messages from a text file and sends these messages to the :term:`Data Link` The :term:`Data Link` component is created from a dbc file with the help of the helper tool ``sdv_bcd_util``.

.. Attention:: To prevent the bypassing of the :term:`Complex Service` we need :term:`Mixed-Criticality`. That can be done when we run two Instances, one in QM Mode, the other in Safety Mode. The connection from The QM instance to the :term:`Basic Service` can be prevented.
   
In the example we still run only one instance, that's why we still have direct access to the :term:`Basic Service`.
