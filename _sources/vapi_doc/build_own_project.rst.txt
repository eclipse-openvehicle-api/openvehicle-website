.. attention:: It is recommended to create a new root folder for your own projects. Do not add your code below the existing framework as the structure is not finalized yet. It will change in future!
   
   To setup an own working space is easy:

- Create the environment variables which are pointing the framework header files and binaries

   | SDV_FRAMEWORK_RUNTIME
   | (.../build/<compiler>/bin)(sdv_control can be found there)
   | The environment variable SDV_FRAMEWORK_RUNTIME needs to be pointing to the SDV V-API framework location!
   | 
   | SDV_COMPONENT_INSTALL
   | (.../build/<compiler>/bin)(sdv_packager can be found there)   
   | The environment variable SDV_COMPONENT_INSTALL needs to be pointing to the SDV V-API component installation location!
   | 
   | SDV_FRAMEWORK_DEV_TOOLS
   | (.../build/<compiler>/bin)(sdv_dbc_util can be found there)
   | The environment variable SDV_FRAMEWORK_DEV_TOOLS needs to be pointing to the SDV V-API development tools location!
   | SSDV V-API framework and SDV V-API development tools may be the same.
   | 
   | SDV_FRAMEWORK_DEV_INCLUDE
   | (.../export)
   | The environment variable SDV_FRAMEWORK_DEV_INCLUDE needs to be pointing to the SDV V-API development include files location!


SDV_FRAMEWORK_RUNTIME ..../build/msvc_x64_x64_ninja_debug/bin
SDV_COMPONENT_INSTALL ..../build/msvc_x64_x64_ninja_debug/bin
SDV_FRAMEWORK_DEV_TOOLS ..../build/msvc_x64_x64_ninja_debug/bin
SDV_FRAMEWORK_DEV_INCLUDE .../export



- Copy the tmp_project folder to any place you like. The tmp_project folder contains a CMakeLists.txt file and a subfolder already. Start your project directly in the subfolder. Use tmp_project folder as root folder.


.. hint:: 
   Keep path names short. If you rename the subfolder or add more folders, then you have to update the CMakeLists.txt file in your root folder accordingly.
